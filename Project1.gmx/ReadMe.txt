Instructions:
In Shapes Must Die! the player's objective is to place the various towers from the menu on the right near the blue outlined path with the goal of destroying the enemies before any of them reach the Green Gate on the right. When placing towers you can place them anywhere on the map except ontop of other towers or on the Path. If you have a tower placed and no longer want it or want to replace it you can right click on the tower to destroy it and get a refund.

There are 4 tower types.
    -The Standard Tower is a cheap average all around tower, it does average damage, and fires fairly quickly.
    -The Slowing Tower is an excellent addition to your defense, it doesn't do much damage but it fires very quickly and permanently lowers the movement speed of each enemy hit.
    -The AOE Tower is a tower that will hit everyone within its range, its does average damage but due to the fact that it has so many potential targets it is an excellent defensive measure.
    -The High Damage tower does the most damage out of all the towers, it fires a bullet at enemies an average distance away at a slower rate, but the bullet for the High Damage tower is a cannon which shoots a shell that blasts through enemies until it reaches an enemy that it cannot kill.

There are 3 enemy types.
    -The small yellow triangles are the fastest weakest enemy.
    -The red diamonds move at an average speed and have an average amount of health.
    -The big orange enemy's have the most health and are the hardest to destroy but they move the slowest.
